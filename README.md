# Dice-game
I created a beautiful, well designed UI interface and fully functional Dice game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

Functionality of this game:-----

• In this game you have two interface, one for player 1 and another for player 2.

• Active player have to roll dice by clicking on ROLL DICE button and the score always get added to the current score until the dice number comes 1, then you lose all the current score.

• But, luckily, before facing 1, if you hold your score by clicking on HOLD button, then all the current score will be added to the total score(main score).

• Clicking HOLD button also leads to change the active player.

• This, game runs until any of the player's main score reach 100.

Then, the game finishes!.

• But, but but don't worry, i also added the functionality of restarting game.

• For this, you just have to click on NEW GAME button.

And the game restarts!
